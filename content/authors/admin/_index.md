I am a software engineer specializing in deep learning. I explored and published a peer-reviewed paper on improving prediction robustness of convolutional neural networks to noise in the input image while retaining state-of-the-art accuracy. From my work at different research institutes, I gathered experience with machine learning in both research and application. I also worked successfully as a freelance software engineer and at different departments of a large corporation. I lived abroad in Australia, China, and the USA. I am most notably familiar with Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Docker, AWS, and Java.
